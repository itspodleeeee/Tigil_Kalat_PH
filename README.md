# ðŸŒ¿ Tigil Kalat PH â€“ A Digital Advocacy Website I Created

**Tigil Kalat PH** is a youth-focused, environmental awareness website I designed and developed as part of a school project. Built using plain HTML and CSS, this project advocates against littering in public places across the Philippinesâ€”a real issue that affects both our cities and natural ecosystems.

I created this site not just to meet an academic requirement, but to express something I genuinely care about: building a culture of cleanliness and responsibility in the Philippines.

## ðŸ§  Why I Made This

Littering may seem small, but when millions of people do it every day, it becomes a massive problem. From flooding in cities to polluted beaches and endangered marine life, the effects are everywhere. I wanted to build a website that informs people about this issue, shows them the real damage, and encourages even small steps toward change.

## ðŸš© Milestone 2 Update: Solutions Section

**Milestone 2 adds a new "Solutions in Action" section:**

- **Solutions in Action:**
  - Highlights real-world solutions to littering in the Philippines, including national laws (Republic Act No. 9003), local ordinances (e.g., Marikina City), and IEC campaigns.
