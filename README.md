# 🌿 Tigil Kalat PH – A Digital Advocacy Website I Created

**Tigil Kalat PH** is a youth-focused, environmental awareness website I designed and developed as part of a school project. Built using plain HTML and CSS, this project advocates against littering in public places across the Philippines—a real issue that affects both our cities and natural ecosystems.

I created this site not just to meet an academic requirement, but to express something I genuinely care about: building a culture of cleanliness and responsibility in the Philippines.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Littering may seem small, but when millions of people do it every day, it becomes a massive problem. From flooding in cities to polluted beaches and endangered marine life, the effects are everywhere. I wanted to build a website that informs people about this issue, shows them the real damage, and encourages even small steps toward change.
